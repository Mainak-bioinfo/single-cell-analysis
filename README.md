# single-cell-analysis

#**Objective**

To elucidate heterogenity in Glioma, single-cell analysis will be performes. Unsupervised clustering of cells using UMAP or PCA. Gene set variation (GSVA) will be used to labels the cell. The cluster obtained will be mapped for receptor-ligand interaction. A comparative understanding of interaction will help in development of new targets for therapy intervation. 

#**Datasets**

Use of multiple Dataset 1.Glioblastoma (Higher Grade tumor) 2. LGG (Lower Grade tumor) 3. Pedaitric Glioma
