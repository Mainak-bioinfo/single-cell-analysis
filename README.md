# single-cell-analysis

#**Objective**

To elucidate heterogenity in Glioma single- cell- analysis will be used. Unsupervised clustering of cells. Gene set variation (GSVA) will be used to labels the cell. The cluster obtained will be mapped for receptor-ligand interaction. A comparative understanding of interaction will help in development of new targets for therapy intervation. 

#**Datasets**

Use of multiple Dataset 1.Glioblastoma (Higher Grade tumor) 2. LGG (Lower Grade tumor) 3. Pedaitric Glioma
